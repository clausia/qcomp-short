    "In quantum computing, we manipulate the state of qubits by applying a series of gates on qubits. In this chapter, I introduce various one-qubit gates commonly used in quantum computing. When a one-qubit gate acts on a single qubit, the Bloch vector of the qubit rotates around a certain axis by a certain angle.  The most general rotation is [*Euler rotation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles), which is done by $U$ gate.  In theory, we need only this gate. However, it is not convenient since we have to figure out three parameters (angles) for each operation.  Furthermore, in actual quantum computing devices, the general gate may not be available.   In practice, we use parameter-free gates with predefined rotation axes and angles, and a few others that require a single parameter.\n",

In one definition, a gate is defined by how the computational basis kets are transformed by the gate.  This definition is practical.  For computational purpose, the matrix expression of the gate is more convenient.  The matrix expression assumes the computational basis. Since every gate is a special case of the general $U$ gate, the gate can be expressed with $U$, which is the third definition.\n"
