    "In this book, we will use various computer tools, *Python*, *JupyterLab*, and *Qiskit*.  In addition, we will use online tools and real quantum computers provided by *IBM Quantum*.  There are many useful tutorials on quantum computing at the IBM Quantum web site.  No previous experience is needed.  However, you must train yourself along with this book.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, Python, JupyterLab, Qiskit, and IBM Quantum are introduced.  Although there are free cloud-based IDEs, it will be convenient to run codes on your computer.  Therefore, it is highly recommended to install them on your computer.  Installation instruction is given in the following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your computer does not have sufficient capacity or if you do not wish to install these software by some reason, two free online IDEs equivalent to JupyterLab, *IBM Quantum Lab* and *Google Colab*, are introduced as well.  Apart from some inconvenience, they work well."
