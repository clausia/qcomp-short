    "As shown in the previous section, quantum entanglement exhibits a weird correlation.  Is it consistent with any known cause of correlation?  John S. Bell showed that any correlation we know must satisfy an inequality (known as *Bell inequality*).  If a correlation that does not satisfies the inequality, it must be due to some unknown  *non-local* effect.  Since all the principles of classical physics are *local*, any violation of the Bell's inequality indicates the existence of non-local effects that cannot be explained by any classical physics.  Various experiments have confirmed that quantum entanglement violates the inequality and thus non-local effect must exist.\n",

    "In this section, we try to understand the Bell's inequality without complicated mathematics through the Bell game. "
