    "First, let us recall that a single qubit is in a two-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathbb{C}^2$ and the computational basis vectors $0\\ramgle$ and $|1\\rangle$ span the space. Now we consider two qubits $q_0$ and $q_1$. The composite system lives in a four-dimensional Hilbert space.  The dimension $4$ is not $2+2$ but $2 \\times 2$.  We write it $\\mathbb{C}^2 \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^2$ where $\\otimes$ indicates *tensor product*.  This mathematical structure is very important. Using the computational basis of each $\\mathbb{C}^2$, we can construct four *computational basis* vectors for the composite system as products $|q_1\\rangle \\otimes |q_0\\rangle$:\n",
