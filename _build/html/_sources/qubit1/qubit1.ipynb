However, the basis vectors do not represent any particular physical basis set.  In real quantum computers,  a qubit can be realized, for example, by an electron spin, $|0\\rangle \\equiv | \\uparrow \\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle \\equiv |\\downarrow \\rangle$ or a polarization of photon, $|0\\rangle \\equiv | H \\rangle$ (horizontal polarization) and $|1\\rangle \\equiv | V \\rangle$ (vertical polarization).  By using the computational basis set, we don't have to worry about what type of hardware is used.  The mathematical expression based on the computational basis can be applied to all of quantum computers based on qubits.\n",
