    "The state of a quantum object is express by a ket in the Hilbert space.  However, the ket is not unique.  Many kets actually corresponds to the same physical state.  If $\\ket{\\varphi}$ represents a state, $|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha \\ket{\\varphi}$ also represent the same state where $\\alpha$ is any complex number. For example, $\\ket{\\varphi}, -\\ket{\\varphi}, i \\ket{\\varphi}, \\frac{1}{2} \\ket{\\varphi}, 2 \\ket{\\varphi}$ all represent the same quantum state. However, the difference is only the scalar factor.    In mathematics, $\\{ \\alpha \\ket{\\varphi}, \\forall \\alpha \\in \\mathbb{C}\\}$ is known as *ray*.   Any ray represents the same quantum state.  Although this ambiguity does not cause a fundamental trouble, it is certainly inconvenient.  We attempt to reduce the ambiguity.    This leads to $|\\alpha|^2=1$.  However, the ambiguity still remains since $\\alpha = e^{i \\theta}$ satisfies the normalization condition with any real value of $\\theta$. In summary, if $|\\varphi\\rangle$ is a normalized state vector, $e^{i \\theta} | \\varphi\\rangle$ is also a normalized state vector and both represent the same physical state. In other word,s $e^{i \\theta}$, which is called *global phase*, does not contribute to the physical state of qubit.  Hence, it can be ignored.  This property is utilized when we develop efficient quantum computing codes.\n"
