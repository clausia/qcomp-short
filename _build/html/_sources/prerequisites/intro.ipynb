    "This book is entirely written in the Jupyter Notebook format and generated by Jupyter Book.  The first section of this chapter explains how the interactive book works.  In the rest of this chapter required software and online tools are introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use computer tools, *Python*, *JupyterLab*, and *Qiskit*.  In addition, we will use online tools and real quantum computers provided by *IBM Quantum Experience*.  No previous experience is needed.  However, you must train yourself along with this book.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of Python, JupyterLab, Qiskit, and IBM Quantum Experience is required. If you do not have your own computer or the capacity of your computer is limited, free cloud-based online services, such as *IBM Quantum Lab* or *Google Colab* satisfy the requirement. Apart from some inconvenience, they work well.  However, it will be convenient to run codes on your computer.  Therefore, it is highly recommended to install required software on your computer.  Installation instruction is given in the following sections."
