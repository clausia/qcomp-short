    "Real numbers are continuous and thus there are uncountable many numbers even upper and lower bounds are limited.  The situation is same in classical computation.  THerefore, we express real numbers approximately using the [*floating-point arithmetic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) method.  Suppose that we write a real number in a scientific notation *mantissa* $\\times$ *scale*, for example in base 10 $0.3452 \\times 10^7$.  We can always make the mantissa less than 1 by adjusting the scaling.  We can also make the mantissa integer as $3452 \\times 10^3$. \n",
    "Therefore, the scientific notation can be written as integer times scaling.\n",

However, for some applications, this is good enough. See for examples, {numref}`sec-qft` and {numref}`sec-qpe`. If $64$ qubits are available, we can encode $2^{64} = 18446744073709551616$ different real numbers between 0 and 1.  That means the gap is approximately $5.42101086 \\times 10^{-20}$, which is small enough for most of applications.  Unfortunately, the currently available quantum computer do not have enough qubits to use floating point arithmetic.\n"
