# Quantum computation obviously relies on the principles of quantum mechanics. You need to understand them to learn quantum computation.  However, traditional quantum mechanics courses usually do not cover the principles essential to quantum computation. Therefore, quantum mechanics is not prerequisite.  No prior knowledge in quantum mechanics is assumed and I introduce relevant parts of quantum mechanics as needed.  If you wish to learn them in depth, the following book is recommended.

# * J. Audretsch: *Entangled Systems - New Directions in Quantum Physics* (Wiley-VCH, 2007)
# 
# The following book is the most popular book on quantum computation and contains a comprehensive introduction to quantum mechanics which covers everything you need to learn quantum computation. Advanced students are encourage to read it.
