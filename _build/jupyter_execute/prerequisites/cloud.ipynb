    "If your computer does not have enough storage or power to run python and jupyter, you can develop python codes and run them on cloud-based online IDEs.  You can also upload the jupyter notebook files used in this book and run them.  The most popular one is *Google Colab*.  However, it is a general purpose IDE and some packages we use are not available.  You must install them manually each time you use their service.[^cloud]  *IBM Quantum Lab* is another cloud-based online IDE and it is designed to work with IBM Quantum Computing service via Qiskit and thus all packages we need are preloaded.  For our purpose, IBM Quantum Lab works better than Google Colab."
