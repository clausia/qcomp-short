    "A classical computer consists of many small building blocks, each of them has two possible states.  We assign indexes to these states, $\\texttt{0}$ and $\\texttt{1}$.  When the device is in one state, we interpret it as `0` and in the other state as `1`.  We call the information stored in this device unit `bit` and use a symbol $b \\in \\{\\texttt{0},\\texttt{1}\\}$.  The computer consists of many bits, bit 0, bit 1, bit 2, .......  For convenience, we denote the bits as $b_0, b_1, b_2, \\cdots $ and altogether the information is stored in a string of n bits, $'\\, b_{n-1}\\, b_{n-2}\\, \\cdots\\, b_1\\, b_0\\, '$, for example $\\texttt{0010101}$."

    "The computer can change the state of any bit at our command.  A simple operation is to flip a bit, that is $0\\rightarrow 1$  and $1 \\rightarrow 0$.  We express it using a concept of _gate_.  A bit enters a gate and comes out with a different value.  In the classical computer, there are only two possibility,  no flip or flip.  \"No flip\" means nothing happens to the bit and thus we are not interesting it.  The gate that flips a bit is called `NOT` gate. (See {numref}`classical-gates`.)  This is the only gate acts on a single bit outputs a single bit.  The relation between the input and the output bit is given in the truth {numref}`table %s <classical-NOT>`.\n",

As a simple example, we consider a boolean operation between two logical variables $x$ and $y$.  Their value is either $\\texttt{True}$ or $\\texttt{False}$.   Since the valiables takes only one of two possibilities, the mapping between the boolean variables and bits are naturally\n",

In other words we to find find what gates should be applied to the bits. Let us consider a simple operation $x+y \\mod 2$ where $x, y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.  WE shall write this operation simply as $x \\oplus y$ . We map $x$ and $y$ to bits $b_0$ and $b_1$. Applying an `XOR` gate on $q_0$ and $b_1$ produces desired outputs.   The following diagram classically computes $x \\oplus y$ and the output is stored in $x$. The value of $y$ remains the same."
