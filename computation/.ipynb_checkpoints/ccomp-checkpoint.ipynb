    " # Classical computation\n",
    " \n",
    "We carry out classical computation every day on many different devices, laptop computers, mobile phones, automobiles, smart TVs, refrigerators, ...  to name a few. These devices are made from semiconductors chips and optionally magnetic materials and their functionalities are governed by quantum mechanics.  Nevertheless, we call them *classical computer*. Why?   While the underlying physical processes are quantum mechanical, *information* stored and processed in these materials is classical.  For example,  macroscopic electric current and voltage, which are classical quantities, are used to store and process information.  In other words, a large number of electrons are used to store even the smallest amount of information.  In contrast, quantum computation relies on microscopic states , e. g.,  energy eigenstates in an atomic ion.  In th following, we discuss what is the classical information and how it is processed in the classical devices."

    "We  ask a question because we do not know something and try to find it.  In other words, wey to get new [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information).  But what is information and can we quantify the amount of information?  To answer this question, [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory) was developed in the first half of twenty century by [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) and others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In essence,  the amount of information we obtain is the amount of uncertainty decreased.  If there is no uncertainty, there is nothing to ask.  The undertainties arise in several different ways.  The outcome of an event that is going to happen in future can be uncertain if we cannot predict it precisely.  The uncertainty is due to the stochastic nature of the event.  IIn another case, the event has already happened and some people know  the outcome but we dont' know it.  For us, this is uncertainty but it is due to our ignorance.  In either case,  once we know the outcome, the uncertainty disappears and we obtain the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The uncertainty can be mathematically expressed as probability.  Consider coin tossing.  For tossing the coin, no one knows the outcome.  However, we know that the outcome must be one of head and tail.  We cannot predict the outcome because the motion of th coin is chaotic and thus the outcome is stochastic.  Assuming the coin is ideal, the probability of finding head and tail ares $p_\\text{head} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $p_\\text{tail}=\\frac{1}{2}$, which is the uncertainty associated with the coin tossing.  The amount of the information (undertainty) is given by\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In classical computers, the information is stored as bit strings in random access memory (RAM).  To process information, the bit strings are copied to the central proccessing unit (CPU).  After the information is processed, the outcome is copied to some location in RAM.   Copying the bits is a fundamental aspect of classical information processsing. As you see below, the input information is usually lost in during processing in CPU.  In contrast, quantum computation does not have such luxury since cloning of quantum state is not possible (*no cloning theorem*)."

    "The computer can change the state of any bit as directed by a program.  A simple operation is to flip a bit, that is $0\\rightarrow 1$  and $1 \\rightarrow 0$.  We express it using a concept of _gate_.  A bit enters a gate and comes out with a different value.  In the classical computer, there are only two possibility,  no flip or flip.  \"No flip\" means nothing happens to the bit and thus we are not interesting it.  The gate that flips a bit is called `NOT` gate. (See {numref}`classical-gates`.)  This is the only gate acts on a single bit outputs a single bit.  The relation between the input and the output bit is given in the truth {numref}`table %s <classical-NOT>`.\n"

    "The irreversibility of classical gates has important physical consequence.  [*Landauer's principle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle) states that the loss of one bit of information necessarily dissipates $k_B T \\log 2$ of heat. For example, every time an  $\\texttt{AND}$ gate is used, at least $k_B T \\log 2$ of heat must be generated. This heat is actually minute and much smaller than Joule heat that makes CPU really hot. Therefore, it odes not causes a significant problem.  However, it imposes a theoretical limit of classical computation.  In contrast, quantum computing is reversible and thus no dissipation is mandatory."

As a simple example, we consider a boolean operation between two logical variables $x$ and $y$.  Their value is either $\\texttt{True}$ or $\\texttt{False}$.
