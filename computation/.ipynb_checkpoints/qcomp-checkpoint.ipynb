    "Quantum computers are also made of many small building blocks but unlike classical computers we need to use quantum mechanics to describe their state. Current quantum computers use the smallest quantum system, that is a two-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathbb{C}_2$ spanned by complex vectors $\\lvert 0 \\rangle$ and $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$, known as _qubit_. These two basis states looks similar to `0` and `1` for a classical bit . However, unlike the classical bit,  the state of a qubit  can be in a superposition state\n",

Similarly to the classical bit, we obtain either $\\ket{0}$ or $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$  when the superposition state is measured.   We shall call them _computational basis_. However,  the state of the qubit is neither $\\lvert 0 \\rangle$ nor $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$  but  $\\lvert 0 \\rangle$ AND $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$ simultaneously. Hence, a qubit can compute two different cases at once (if a programmer is smart enough). Quantum computers exploit this superposition state.  Unlike the classical bit which has only two possible states, a qubit can take infinitely many different states since $c_0$ and $c_1$ can be any complex numbers satisfying the normalization condition. \n",

Similarly  the pair of qubits are spanned by four basis vectors $\\lvert 00 \\rangle$, $\\lvert 01 \\rangle$, $\\lvert 10 \\rangle$, and $\\lvert 11 \\rangle$.

If there are $n$ qubits, the number of terms in the superposition state can be as many as $2^n$.   Then, $2^n$ different cases are simultaneously computed. We will take the advantage in various applications.\n",

    "The time-evolution of qubits  is a unitary transformation determined by the Shcr&ouml;dinger equation.  Quantum computers manipulate the qubits by applying a unitary operator $U$.  Starting an initial state $|\\psi_i\\rangle$, the final state (the solution of the quantum computation) is mathematically given by $|\\psi_f\\rangle = U |\\psi_i\\rangle$.  The quantum algorithm determines the unitary operator $U$. Recall that $U$ is $2^n \\times 2^n$ matrix for $n$ qubits, which is huge.   How can we construct such a huge matrix?  It turns out that a set of signle qubit unitary operators ($2\\times 2$ matrix) and two-qubit unitary operators ($4 \\times 4$) can realize $U$.  Such unitary matrices are knwon as *gates*.  To obtain a desired final state, we just apply a set of one-qubit gates and two-qubit gates successively.  In addition to the unitaries, we also need to measure the qubits using measurement gates.  The set of the gates is called [*quantum circuit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit).  A simple example is given below."

In contrast, quantum computers can change the state of a qubit in infinitely many different ways.  Here we use also the concept of gates.  A qubit enters a gate and comes out in a different state.  In other words, a state vector of the qubit is transformed to another state vector by the gate.  In quantum mechanics, that is achieved by a unitary transformation $U$.

    "## Readouts\n",
    "\n",
    "When a qubit is in $\\lvert 0 \\rangle$ or $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$, readout is in principle accurate (not on current NISQ computers due to device errors). However, the outcome is completely uncertain if the qubit is in a superposition state {eq}`eqn:superposition`. We will obtain $\\texttt{0}$ or $\\texttt{1}$ at random.  If we prepare many qubits in the same superposition state, we obtain $\\texttt{0}$ from some and $\\texttt{1}$ from others. Hence, the readout of qubits is stochastic, from which we know that the qubits are in a superposition state but which one?  The principle of quantum mechanics tells us that the probability of getting $\\texttt{0}$ is given by $|c_0|^2$ and $\\texttt{1}$ by $|c_1|^2$.  By measuring many qubits in the same state, we can calculate the probabilities from which $|c_0|^2$ and $|c_1|^2$ can be determined.  The phase of $c_0$ and $c_1$ are still missing.  There is a complicate procedure, known as _quantum tomography_, which can determine the superposition state if and only if sufficiently large number of the same superposition states are measured.  Therefore, it is necessary to repeat the same quantum computation many times if the final result is a superposition state.  Even when the result of the computation is designed to be $\\lvert 0 \\rangle$ or $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$ by the algorithm, the outcome can be a superposition state due to device errors.  Even worse, the final state can be so-called _mixed state_, which contains a mixture of classical and quantum uncertainties simultaneously.  A good quantum circuit avoids both classical and quantum uncertainties as much as possible."
